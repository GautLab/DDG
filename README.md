# DDG: Domestication Discussion Group
Meeting time is 1 - 2 PM (Pacific Time) on Thursdays. We will be meeting on the UCI campus (Steinhaus Hall 267) but participants may join from remote locations.

### What is this discussion group?
- Informal discussion centered on the domestication of crop species
- Focused on reading relevant books, classic literature, understanding modern tools and their applications, and interpretating results

### General Plan

We will discuss a different article relating to domestication each week this fall. Please see below for a more detailed schedule.
